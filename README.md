<b> Savings without all the paperwork </b>

  rEwards is a mobile loyalty card application. It enables people to keep track of their reward points at participating businesses. With each purchase, a business can increment a customer’s reward points by scanning the customer’s QR code. The users will be able to redeem any rewards they earn. Many businesses have customer loyalty programs where a certain number of purchases let you redeem a free or discounted product. However, users participating in multiple reward programs could find it difficult to keep track of all their reward points and rewards they have available to use. rEwards solves this by condensing all of their loyalty programs into one mobile app.
